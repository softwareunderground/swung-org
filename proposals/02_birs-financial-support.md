Type: Workshop


## Abstract

The proposal is intended to ask Software Underground to provide financial
support to participants of the upcoming [BIRS][birs.ca] Workshop ["Open-source
tools to enable geophysical data processing and inversion"][birs2023].
During this event, the communities of [Fatiando a Terra][fatiando] and
[SimPEG][simpeg] will gather to work and plan the future development of
open-source tools in geophysics.

The financial support would be mainly aimed to cover travel and meal expenses
of participants that cannot count on any additional funding sources, or won't
be able to attend without it.


## Motivation and scope

The authors of this proposal are organizing a two days workshop at the [Banff
International Research Station (BIRS)][birs.ca], happening from July 28 to July
30, 2023, in Banff, Canada.
During this workshop, the communities of users and developers of [Fatiando
a Terra][fatiando] and [SimPEG][simpeg] will gather to work on developing
a fully open-source geophysical workflow that covers processing raw data to
producing interpretable models; improving the interoperability and usability of
their tools; and nurturing community building, increasing diversity and
sustainability whiten these projects.

BIRS' organization will provide the venue where the event will take place, and
cover in-person participants' accommodation for two nights, inside BIRS campus.
Nevertheless, participants will have to gather their own funds to cover
travelling and food costs.

In the spirit of increasing the diversity within these two communities, we
would like to provide financial support to participants that might encounter
difficulties ensuring the fundings to cover the costs of attending the
workshop.

The goals of this workshop are very aligned with the ones of Software
Underground. We consider this will be a very valuable event for the Fatiando
and SimPEG projects, for Software Underground, and for the broader
geoscientific community.


## Detailed description

In this proposal we would like to ask Software Underground for financial
support to:

* totally or partially cover travel expenses for two participants;
* totally or partially cover meal expenses for three participants, and
* purchase _swag_ for the Workshop (optionally).

Participant's travel costs include any expense that participants might have to
afford in order to travel from their current residency to BIRS facilities
through an direct route: flight tickets, ferry tickets and ground
transportation expenses (transit, gas usage).
Meal expenses will include all meals that the participant will have to afford
during the days of the workshop and travel days.

In addition, some portion of these funds will be assigned to
purchasing to _swag_ expenses, such as stickers, T-shirts and/or customized
notebooks.
These will include logos and content related to Software Underground, Fatiando
a Terra, SimPEG, BIRS, the Workshop, and other geosciences-related communities
and projects.
Swag items will be purchased only after participant's travel and meal expenses
have been covered, with any remaining funds.

As organizers, we identified a few participants that qualify as _beneficiaries_
for receiving this financial support. This selection was carried out
considering that these participants:

1. have confirmed their **in-person** attendance to the workshop;
2. lack of third-party funding sources to **partially** or **totally** cover
   these expenses; and
3. **expressed the need** for financial support from event organizers.

The list of beneficiaries contains three participants that would require some
level of financial support. Through this proposal we would like to ask Software
Underground the funds to cover the meal expenses for the three beneficiaries,
the travel costs for two of them, and some additional funds to cover swag
expenses.

## Cost

### Meal expenses

Considering that most of the meal expenses will take place during the event,
we'll use the prices of [meals offered by
BIRS](https://www.birs.ca/frequently-asked-questions#Meals) as a guide to
estimate costs per beneficiary.

| Meal              | Cost (CAD) |
|-------------------|------------|
| Breakfast         |    18.43   |
| Lunch             |    22.15   |
| Dinner            |    29.42   |
| **Total per day** |  **70.00** |

This adds up to **70 CAD** of meal expenses per day per beneficiary.
In order to cover the meal expenses for three participants during the two days
of workshop, they would sum up a total of **420 CAD**.

### Travel costs

We would cover the travel costs for two participants that need to travel from
within North America to Banff. Considering flight tickets and ground
transportations, the travel costs would be of approximately 660 CAD for each
participant.
Travel costs would sum up **1320 CAD**.

### Swag

We would add **260 CAD** for purchasing swag for the Workshop.

### Total costs

|               | Cost (CAD)  |
|---------------|-------------|
| Meal expenses |    420.00   |
| Travel costs  |   1320.00   |
| Swag          |    260.00   |
| **Total**     | **2000.00** |

Through this proposal we would like to ask Software Underground to provide up
to **2000.00 CAD** to cover meal, travel and (optionally) swag expenses for the
BIRS Workshop.


## Implementation

Software Underground will provide the fundings for covering beneficiaries'
costs in advance, and/or through reimbursement.
Beneficiaries will be required to provide tickets, bills and proof of payment
for the expenses covered by this financial aid.
These expenses will be reviewed by the event organizers and by Software
Underground Board, and ultimately approved for reimbursement.

Beneficiaries can choose to remain anonymous to the general public and Software
Underground community.
They can opt-out of being mentioned as beneficiaries in any public release of
the event, social media publication and blog post.
Beneficiaries' personal information will be required to be disclosed only to
the event organizers and Software Underground Board Members.

After the event, the Workshop will output some written products in a form of
blog posts, tutorials, or similar.
Their content will be related to topics of interest for Software Underground,
such as participant's experience during the workshop, content for future
Transform tutorials, plans for nurturing our communities, etc.
These blog posts will be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution
license, allowing Software Underground to publish them on its website and
social media.


## Alternatives

Some of the selected participants and the organizers have applied to
third-party financial support provided by [BIRS Partners][birs-partners].
By June 2 we haven't received any confirmation or denial from any of them.
In the hypothetical case that the organizers or any beneficiary gather the
funds to partially or totally cover their travel and meal expenses, the
financial aid provided by Software Underground would be used to cover any
remaining expenses of the other participants, spent on swag, or ultimately
returned to Software Underground.
