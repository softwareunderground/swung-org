## Abstract

Briefly describe the proposal in up to four sentences. Provide some
justification for it. Focus on the outcomes for Swung's members. **This
may be the only part that some people read.**


## Motivation and scope

Provide some background and context for the proposal. What provoked the need
for the change, action, or technology you're proposing?


## Detailed description

This is the meat of the proposal. Describe what you're proposing in at
least a couple of paragraphs. Use subsections (use `### Subhead` if you
need to. Include relevant links or data tables using Markdown.


## Cost

Provide some relevant financial background. Exactly what you need to 
show here depends on the specific proposal. But try to anticipate questions
the board might have. For example:

* What does Swung currently spend on trying to solve this problem?
* What would your proposal cost in the near term (e.g. for a small experiment)?
* What might it cost in the medium term (e.g. in the first year of operation)?
* Break costs down into capital cost, operating cost, and labour cost (or time).
* Use USD or EUR please.
* If you can only provide estimates, give ranges.


## Implementation

How exactly would Software Underground go about implementing your proposal?

Again, think about the near-term, e.g. for a proof-of-concept, and the longer
term, e.g. for a full implementation. Think about your own role in the
implementation.


## Challenges and risks

What are the possible downsides or speedbumps of implementing your idea? 
And how can we mitigate them?


## Alternatives

If there are alternative solutions, list them here and justify the proposed 
approach.


## Discussion

* Links to relevant discussion of these issues in the Software Underground Slack 
or elsewhere.


## References

Provide any relevant references and links, or put them in the text of your
proposal.
