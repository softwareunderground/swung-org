# Financial report 2024

This is a brief financial summary for the financial year 2024. Our financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December.


## Background

Software Underground was founded by Agile Scientific as an informal organization in 2014, then re-founded as a non-profit corporation in April 2020. Software Underground has been operating as a fully autonomous and fincancially independent entity since January 2021.


## Summary of relevant events

## Assets and liabilities

The society had CAD 17,467 in its chequing account at the end of the year. This is an decrease of 10.0% compared to 2023's effective closing balance of CAD 19.907. Unlike last year, however, the society had no major liabilities at the end of the year.

The society also owns CAD 2,000.00 in a 12-month GIC (guaranteed investment certificate, equivalent to cash). The GIC is required to secure the credit card so is not liquid. It generates a small amount of interest each year.


## Cash flow

Expenses have dropped from CAD 5845 in 2023 to CAD 4523 this year &mdash; a 22.6% reduction, mostly due to this being the first full year without Slack. Hovever, income has also fallen from CAD 4766 to CAD 2600. Given this 2024 income and expenses, the society is not balancing income and expenses, having lost CAD 1923 over the last year.
