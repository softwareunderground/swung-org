# Financial report 2023

This is a brief financial summary for the financial year 2023, the third full year for the Software Underground as a non-profit organization. Our financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December.


## Background

Software Underground was founded by Agile Scientific as an informal organization in 2014, then re-founded as a non-profit corporation in April 2020. Software Underground has been operating as a fully autonomous and fincancially independent entity since January 2021.


## Summary of relevant events

## Assets and liabilities

The society had CAD 21,406.76 in its chequing account at the end of the year. This is an increase of 3.55% compared to 2022's closing balance of CAD 20,672.79. However, the society had one major liability at the end of the year: it owed CAD 2,000.00 to Matt Hall for the BIRS bursaries, the payment of which was complex owing to Matt's recent move to Norway. This complexity has been solved by transferring the bank account etc to Matteo, who is resident in Nova Scotia.

Without this liability, the society had CAD 19,406.76 in its chequing account at the end of the year. This is a decrease of 6.12% compared to 2022's closing balance.

The society also owns CAD 2,000.00 in a 12-month GIC (guaranteed investment certificate, equivalent to cash). The GIC is required to secure the credit card so is not liquid.


## Cash flow

Given a 2023 income of CAD 4766 and expenses of CAD 5845, the society is not quite balancing income and expenses, having lost CAD 1079 over the last year.
